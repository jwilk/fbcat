Overview
========

**fbcat** takes a screenshot using the Linux framebuffer device.
Two executables are provided:

* Low-level ``fbcat`` that operates on the current virtual terminal and writes
  the screenshot to stdout in the PPM format:

  .. code:: console

     $ fbcat > screenshot.ppm
     $ file screenshot.ppm
     screenshot.ppm: Netpbm image data, size = 1280 x 1024, rawbits, pixmap

* High-level ``fbgrab`` that supports the PNG format and virtual terminal
  switching:

  .. code:: console

     $ fbgrab '-?'
     Usage: fbgrab [option...] <filename.png|->

     Options:
     -c <N>      grab from /dev/ttyN
     -C <N>      grab from /dev/ttyN, for slower devices
     -d <dev>    use framebuffer device <dev>
     -i          turn on PNG interlacing
     -s <N>      sleep <N> seconds before making screenshot
     -?          display this help and exit

     If the specified destination is "-", the PNG output is piped to stdout.

See the manual pages for details.
